## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22.12.0 or higher
- Discord Bot Token
- API Keys (optional):
  - NVIDIA API key (for AI chat)

### Installation

1. Clone or download the bot files

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file with your tokens:
```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_key_here
BOT_OWNER_IDS=your_discord_id_here
```

4. Run the bot:
```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions Runner

1. Add the secrets `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `BOT_OWNER_IDS`, `REPO_TOKEN` (classic PAT with repo/workflow scope), and (optionally) `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
2. Every push to `main` runs the `lint` job from `.github/workflows/bot.yml`, which uses Node 22.12.0 and executes `npm run lint` to ensure all JavaScript files parse cleanly.
3. To host the bot directly from GitHub Actions, trigger the `doro-bot` workflow manually (`workflow_dispatch`). The `run-bot` job installs production dependencies under Node 22.12.0 and starts `node index.js` with your secrets for text/economy features (Discord voice still requires a local/VPS host).
4. During `run-bot`, the workflow automatically restarts the bot after crashes, keeps it online for ~6 hours (stopping 20 seconds early), commits JSON data changes, and—once past 5.5 hours with a successful commit—dispatches the next workflow run so sessions chain continuously.
